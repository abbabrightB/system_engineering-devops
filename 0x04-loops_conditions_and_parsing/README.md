# 0x04. Loops, Conditions and Parsing

This project covers the fundamentals of loops, conditional statements, and file parsing in Bash scripting. It includes the use of `for`, `while`, and `until` loops, conditional blocks such as `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `case`, and basic pattern matching.
The tasks reinforce how to:
- Automate repetitive operations using loops.
- Apply conditional logic based on numeric and string comparisons.
- Parse filenames and extract components.
- Inspect file properties and respond accordingly.
- Follow clean, executable Bash scripting practices.
